# The Pie Factory Web Application
## Objective
The purpose of this project was to use React to build a SPA for a Houston wholesale pie/dessert distributor. 

## Lessons Learned
 - For the gallery, we can minimize the number of import statements needed to bring in the photos by creating an index.js in the /img folder which places all of the import/export statements in a single file. We can then import the images we need in a single line under the Component file using: import { imgName1, imgName2, ... } from './img'
